    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2> Hey There! </h2>
    <p> My name's Colin and I love every aspect of game development, computer science, and writing code.
        I recently graduated with my Bachelor's of Computer Science from Kennesaw State University and I've been enjoying spending my time away from the office constantly learning, growing my skills, and forging a path towards
        my passion of working on games, but like any other new grads, I'm motivated to begin my career at a company where I can continue to grow forward in my passions while bringing the absolute best work, attitude and character
        I can with me along the way. (If you might be that company, feel free to <a href=colinallen.work@gmail.com>reach out!</a>)
    </p><p>    
        My interest in programming started within the realm of computer games. From the moment I played my first,
        I knew I wanted to make them. Back then, we didn't have popular, commercial game engines to use, so you had to do what you could. I remember
        my first game was made in PowerPoint on my dad's work computer using corporate logos as sprites and slides as each individual stage.
    </p><p>
        Nowadays, after gaining knowledge and experience using both modern game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine 5, I still find myself with that
        same desire to do things in a more niche way. In a way I can learn deeply through understanding how games are working under the hood. The outlet
        for me has been studying the architecture, design, and development of game engines.
    </p><p>
        While my goal is to work in the games industry, and with Unity and Unreal being the proverbial 'industry standard', I still work with those tools
        and learn more each day. However, I am also taking time to write my own engine, piece by piece. The amount of invaluable information I've been learning 
        and experience I've been gaining while developing this engine is very important to me as it will allow me to acquire better foundational knowledge on the
        programs and games I dream to one day create.
    </p><p>
        If you've read this far, thank you. It's been a long road getting here and I couldn't be more thankful to have the opportunity to share where I'm at with you.
        If you would like to reach out for any reason, please feel free to do so <a href=colinallen.work@gmail.com>here.</a>
